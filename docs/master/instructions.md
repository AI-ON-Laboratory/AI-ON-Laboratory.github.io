## Best Practices for Writing Python Code ‚úçÔ∏è

### Writing Clean and Readable Code

*   Use meaningful variable names: avoid single-letter names and make sure the name clearly indicates the variable's purpose.
*   Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task.
*   Use consistent naming conventions throughout your code (e.g., camelCase or underscore notation).
*   Organize your code using comments, docstrings, and whitespace.

### Following PEP 8 Guidelines

*   Keep lines of code short (80 characters or less) to improve readability.
*   Use consistent indentation (4 spaces or a consistent number of spaces).
*   Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
*   Use parentheses to group expressions and improve clarity.

### Writing Comments and Docstrings

*   Write comments to explain non-obvious code sections or complex logic.
*   Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules.
*   Keep comments and docstrings concise and accurate.
*   Use comment blocks to separate sections of code and improve organization.

### Error Handling and Debugging

*   Use try/except blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
*   Write descriptive error messages to help diagnose issues.
*   Use logging to track application events and errors.
*   Test your code thoroughly to catch bugs and edge cases.

### Version Control and Collaboration

*   Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.
*   Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   Use branches to manage different versions of your code.
*   Follow established coding standards and best practices.



## Before submitting the thesis üèÅ

*   Review your code for readability and reproducibility (e.g., set fixed random states in functions that require them).
*   Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
*   Document your code using comments and docstrings.
*   Write a README file that explains how to run your code and reproduce your results.
*   After all your code and data is pushed to the repository, inform the Lab members that your work is ready for review.

## After submitting the thesis and graduating üèÜ

*   Celebrate your achievement with your friends and family.
*   Update your LinkedIn profile and resume with your new skills and accomplishments.
*   REMOVE from your computer any sensitive data related to the project.
